Last Updated: 3/17/2023

This Privacy Policy outlines how the ChatGPT for iPhone app (the "App") collects, uses, and protects your personal information. By using the App, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

## Data Collection

The App does not collect any personal information directly. However, the App accesses and interacts with the ChatGPT API provided by OpenAI, which may collect and store data you provide through the App.

The App uses the data you enter solely to provide you with the intended functionality of interacting with ChatGPT. The data you provide through the App is sent to OpenAI's servers to process your requests and generate responses.

Please note that OpenAI has its own privacy policy, which you can review at https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy to understand how they handle your data.

## Data Protection

We take your privacy seriously and implement appropriate measures to protect your personal information. However, please be aware that no method of data transmission or storage is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.

## Third-Party Services

The App uses OpenAI's ChatGPT API to provide its core functionality. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of third-party services, and we encourage you to review their privacy policies to understand how they handle your data.

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any significant changes by posting the new Privacy Policy in the App's GitHub repository. Your continued use of the App after any changes to the Privacy Policy constitutes your acceptance of the updated terms.
